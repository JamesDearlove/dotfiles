Git repo store for all the configs I might need

## Setup Scripts

I have setup scripts for various operating systems, usually to setup the environments I run under them.

### Ubuntu (and similar)

This script was originally designed for my Ubuntu WSL environment for all my dev. It installs various tools and CLIs I've needed for work and shell customistations.

Run a terminal and run the `setup.sh` script. It will require sudo access.

### Windows

This sets up a basic Windows install with Firefox, VSCode, and a couple of developer tools. It does tinker with GPO, so don't run directly on a corporate device.

Run a Windows PowerShell as admin, and run the `windows-setup.ps1` script.

### Mac

In progress, haven't setup that many Macs recently to need it.
