Git repo store for all the configs I might need

## Setup Scripts

I have setup scripts for various operating systems, usually to setup the environments I run under them.

### Windows

This sets up a basic Windows install with Firefox, VSCode, and a couple of developer tools.

Run a Windows PowerShell (built in v5.1, not v7) as admin, and run the `windows-setup.ps1` script.

### Mac

In progress, haven't setup that many Macs recently to need it.

### Ubuntu

This script was originally designed for my Ubuntu WSL environment for all dev work. It contains various tools and CLIs I've needed for work and shell customistations.

Run a terminal and run the `setup.sh` script. It will require sudo access.
